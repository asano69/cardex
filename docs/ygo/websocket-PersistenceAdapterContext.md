package websocket // import "github.com/reearth/ygo/provider/websocket"
type PersistenceAdapterContext interface {
	// StoreUpdateContext is the context-aware variant of StoreUpdate. It is
	// called with a ctx that is cancelled when Server.Shutdown begins. The
	// adapter should respect cancellation (e.g., abort the network call or
	// DB transaction) and return ctx.Err() when ctx is done.
	StoreUpdateContext(ctx context.Context, room string, update []byte) error
}
    PersistenceAdapterContext is an optional extension to PersistenceAdapter.
    Adapters that implement this interface receive a context that is cancelled
    when the server begins shutdown, letting the adapter abort in-flight
    writes (network calls, DB queries, etc.) rather than blocking Shutdown
    indefinitely.
    The persistence worker checks for this interface at runtime via a type
    assertion. Adapters that implement only PersistenceAdapter remain fully
    supported — the worker falls back to StoreUpdate when StoreUpdateContext is
    unavailable.
    Pattern mirrors io.WriterTo / http.CloseNotifier and the database/sql/driver
    Queryer / QueryerContext family in the standard library.
